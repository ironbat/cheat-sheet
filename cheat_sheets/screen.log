When a Screen session is detached, the processes that were running inside it aren't stopped. You can re-attach a detached session by typing
screen -r
in a terminal

Virtual terminals in Screen can be manipulated by pressing the Ctrl+A key combination, and subsequently pressing a key to execute one of the commands given below:
